##TMR (The Minecraft Robot)
####<em>Version 0.7</em>

An API for TMR that will run custom scripts written by others!

This is currently being uploaded while bugs are being fixed. Be patient plez.

The Minecraft Robot is a macro client for the popular game Minecraft. Ofcourse, the only way this is possible is by this API. TMR is currenlty not publically released as I'm just rolling out API updates and working on creating a site and buying a domain name.

TMR's API is very similar to the old RSBot's API, there are classes designed specifically for: player interaction; world interaction; inventory interaction, and hopefully soon will add in help for Entity interactions, and other container interactions.

Another note: this API is still in the early stages, so surely theres bound to be bugs that need a good squashing. I'm working very hard, taking time out of schooling to fix these bugs, but in saying that, if you find something which is silly, don't hesitate to throw a push request this way.
